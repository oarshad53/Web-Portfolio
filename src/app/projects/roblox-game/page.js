          A simple, yet fun multiplayer combat game built in Luau using the ROBLOX engine. Features dynamic player
         abilities, UI cooldown indicators, and a client-server combat architecture designed to reduce latency and exploitability.

                    <li>Designed and implemented a player-vs-player combat system with hit detection and state-based interactions (e.g., blocking, invulnerability)</li>
                    <li>Created UI cooldown indicators tied to player abilities for clear visual feedback</li>
                    <li>Used RemoteEvents to delegate core combat logic to the server-side, minimizing the risk of client-side exploits</li>
                    <li>Leveraged client-side scripts for visual and non-critical feedback to reduce server load</li>
                    <li>Tuned ability cooldowns and damage timing to balance gameplay</li>
                    <li>Implemented modular scripts for easier future scalability (e.g., ability expansion)</li>

      <p className = "font-outfit text-lg pt-5 pb-5">This project was a valuable opportunity to apply my programming skills in a new context. While my prior experience
         was primarily focused on data structures and foundational programming, working with the ROBLOX Engine allowed me to explore game development through a physics-based lens. 
         I gained hands-on experience solving complex, real-time problems involving physics interactions and gameplay systems, which expanded both my technical versatility and 
         understanding of applied programming.
